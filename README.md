This web application is meant to share photos using NASA's API (https://api.nasa.gov/). Using the API we were supposed to present the photos to the user in away way we awnted as long as the image contained a title, date, and the ability for the user to like or dislike a photo. I spent time creating a prototype before coding out an iteration for the challenge. I learned a lot through the challenge, and I'm glad that I got to particpate.

## Notables

This application focuses on providing their clients with clean UI & UX while also having strong values in accessibility, I wanted to make sure that my application kept this in mind. I was introduced to a great tool called Lighthouse in the Chrome Developer tools, and I was able to really narrow down what areas that I had to focus on.

Based on the feedback that I received from the tool, I was able to better pinpoint areas that I had overlooked while developing the application. By the end of the submission, I had a web application that scored well in SEO, Accessible, and Best Practices.
